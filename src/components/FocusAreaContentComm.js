              Build teams that can effectively engage with and mobilize the
              community.
            </span>
            FOSS communities and projects need to actively and responsibly
            allocate funds and resources for community mobilization and other
            activities. Most Indian FOSS Leaders were originally developers who
            recognized this need and became community mobilisers. Building a
            well-supported team with shared responsibility prevents putting the
            pressure of such a critical role on a single person, who often feels
            the need to be constantly “on”, that leads to burnout and
            resignations.

            <span>Eg:</span> Succession Planning for FOSS Communities<br /><br/>

            FOSS Communities

            creating structures of financial and legal support for FOSS
            communities to begin and foster projects that are driven by a need
            to solve a problem would increase project retention, contribution
            and support from within the community resulting in more robust and
